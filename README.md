Project Overview

This project is a straightforward web-based tool designed for creating invoices. Users can input seller information, billing and shipping addresses, order details, and item specifics, and the tool generates a formatted invoice that can be printed.

Implementation

HTML: The index.html file establishes the webpage structure, featuring input fields for necessary information and placeholders to guide users. It includes a form for entering invoice details and a section to display the generated invoice.

CSS: The styles.css file enhances the appearance of the input form and the generated invoice, ensuring a user-friendly interface.

JavaScript: The script.js file contains the logic for generating the invoice based on user input. It supports adding multiple items and includes a function for printing the generated invoice.

Node.js and Express: The app.js file sets up a basic server using Express. This server serves static files and listens on a specified port (typically 3000) to deliver the index.html file as the main page.

Dependencies: Managed via package.json, including Express for running the server.

Usage

Setup:

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm install.
Running the Application:

Start the server with npm start.
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Generating an Invoice:

Fill out the form fields with required information, including seller details, billing and shipping addresses, order specifics, and item details.
Click "Add Item" to include additional items.
Once all fields are filled, click "Generate Invoice".
Printing the Invoice:

After generating the invoice, click "Print Invoice" to open the print dialog and print the invoice.
This project offers a simple and customizable solution for creating and printing invoices, ideal for small businesses or personal use.
